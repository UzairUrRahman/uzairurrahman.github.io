Terminal Tools For Mac OS and Linux
==============

1\. install-nothing
-------------------

If you're feeling drowsy during the office and need a valid excuse to sleep while your boss is around, install-nothing.

Use install-nothing and doze off on the desk.

2\. gti
-------

When they typoed sl for ls, a steam locomotive ran across their Terminal window and they had to wait until it went away to carefully type ls.

Six of the Dumbest HomeBrew Tools for Mac That Actually Exist

#1, #5, #6 are completely dumb in every way

Today I found gti and installed it. This is a l'il nicer.

Whenever they type gti for git, it, sure, runs a locomotive (car this time), but then executes git init, so they don't have to.

I've finally implemented the command I keep typing all day: gti. It's a program that displays a badly made ASCII-art...

3\. mapscii
-----------

Everyone uses Google/Apple Maps.

But if you want to appear like a hard-code err.. core programmer, you need to use ASCII-type maps right inside your Terminal.

Yup, a zoomable world map in Terminal!

4\. daktilo
-----------

I'm a kinda nostalgia-freak.

We still use our 50-yr old rotary dial telephone and a 125-yr old mechanical pendulum clock. They're perfectly intact.

But that lovely typewriter... I still miss it. It was toppled down and smashed by a cat that peeped into the house for milk.

Mad cat.

Anyways, life had been chugging along as usual. And it's been long since that antique faded from my thoughts.

Recently, however, I found a Homebrew tool that's getting me that nostalgia back: daktilo.

Simply use daktilo on Terminal and your Mac will play typewriter sounds every time you press a keyboard key --- even outside Terminal!

Flags to try:

daktilo : Plays the classic typewriter effect
daktilo -p : Can be used to play any of the following presets.

| Preset Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| default | the classic typewriter effect |
| basic | a more basic typewriter effect |
| musicbox | plays random music notes |
| ducktilo | quack quack 🦆 |
| drumkit | dum, tss, cha 🥁 |

Use multiple -p's in one command for multiple presets.

To variate the sounds and have a more realistic typewriter effect, vary the preset's tempo and volume. Ex: --variate-tempo 0.9,0.4 --variate-volume 0.1,0.5.

Fun facts:

-   daktilo is "typewriter" in Turkish, derived from the Ancient Greek word δάκτυλος for "finger".
-   "Typewriter" is the longest word that can be typed with letters of a single keyboard row.

5\. no-more-secrets
-------------------

My cousin just passed CPA --- not because he loved the subject, but because his father wanted him to do it. He wanted to become a movie director instead.

He's so passionate about movies that when his father isn't around, he'd easily distract from studies to streaming top movies on Netflix or writing screenplay for his debut project.

It's a sci-fi cyberpunk film. He named it "We're Tamed by Aliens".

In the climax scene, the protagonist manages to hack into satan's file server and decrypt a dark secret which eventually leads to the collapse of the satan empire.

For that, he wanted a Terminal animation like that in the 1992 movie Sneakers (0:35 in this video ↓)

While he's struggling to contact real bash experts to recreate that effect, I showed him this Homebrew tool no-more-secrets that finally broke his sleeplessness streak.

He simply needed to add | nms to whatever he types before it to show off an animation as if he really decrypted it.

For example:

ls -l / | nms
cowsay nggyu | nms
echo helloworld | nms

But if he really wanted to replay the original sneakers effect for nostalgia, he can simply use sneakers.

6\. cmatrix and fakesteak
-------------------------

Sometimes when I feel bored, I just wanna leave everything and go out into nature. This helps recover myself from programming-induced burnout.

But won't my Mac feel bored if I leave it behind, doing nothing with it? (I know I'm exaggerating this, lol)

So as I leave it on, I turn on cmatrix or fakesteak. (Both are Homebrew tools that have a similar appearance)

This plays an animation resembling the iconic green-matrix cipher code from the movie The Matrix.

I leave it on full-screen and it appears like it's a native screensaver.

Best part, when I come back rejuvenated, I always find a guy or two asking how I set that screensaver on my Mac. It helped me make a few friends too :)

7\. lolcat and nyancat
----------------------

Now, let's talk about the cat who calls Terminal home and loves rainbows.

You can call it with either of two names: lolcat and nyancat. Here's what it does when you call it with:

lolcat: It MTGA (Makes Terminal Great Again) by coloring outputs with rainbow colors. You just need to add | lolcat after a command. For example: cowsay hey cat | lolcat.
