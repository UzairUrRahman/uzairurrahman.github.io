# How to Answer a CTO (How You SOUND Matters)

A CTO does not want:

-   Agile theory
-   PM jargon
-   “We’ll re-prioritize” with no mechanics

They want:

-   Decision framework
-   Trade-off logic
-   Risk containment

## CTO-Level Answer Structure (Use This Every Time)

Context → Risk → Options → Decision → Communication

Example opening line you can literally say:

> “When a client is adamant and non-technical, I stop debating opinions and shift the conversation to risk and trade-offs.”

That sentence alone sounds senior.

## Handling an Adamant, Non-Technical Client (What You ACTUALLY Say)

❌ Weak Answer (PM-ish)

> “I explain why it’s not feasible and ask them to reconsider.”

✅ Strong CTO-Level Answer

> “I never tell a non-technical client they’re wrong. I translate their request into time, risk, and cost, then let them choose.”

### Example Scenario

Client says:

> “This is a small change. Just add it.”

You say (verbatim):

> “I understand why this feels small from a business point of view. Technically, this change impacts authentication and data validation. We have three options:
> 
> 1.  Add it now — delivery moves by 2 weeks
> 2.  Ship current scope and add it in Phase 2
> 3.  Add a limited version now with guardrails
> 
> My recommendation is option 3 because it protects the release date while reducing risk.”

⚠️ Notice:

-   You didn’t argue
-   You gave choices
-   You made a recommendation
-   CTOs LOVE this.

## Reprioritization Without Killing Scope or Delivery

(This is what you were really asking)

You’re right to be suspicious of “just reprioritize.” Bad reprioritization breaks projects.

### The Rule CTOs Follow

You can’t change priority without changing something else.

So when you reprioritize, you explicitly move one of these:

-   Lever
-   What Changes
-   Scope
-   Feature depth or breadth
-   Time
-   Delivery date
-   Quality
-   Guardrails, edge cases
-   Risk
-   Known technical debt

## How Reprioritization ACTUALLY Works (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Freeze the Core

You identify non-negotiables:

> “These 3 items must ship for the system to function.”

This protects delivery.

### Step 2: Classify Work (Simple, CTO-Friendly)

You mentally bucket everything into:

-   Must-Have (system breaks without it)
-   Should-Have (important but deferrable)
-   Nice-to-Have (value, not required)

You don’t say “MoSCoW” in the interview — just do it.

### Step 3: Trade, Don’t Add

When a client pushes a new request, you say:

> “We can absolutely do this, but to keep the date, we’d need to move X out of scope. Would you rather delay delivery or defer X?”

This is controlled reprioritization.

## Will This Affect Scope or Delivery? (Honest CTO Answer)

Say this confidently:

> “Reprioritization always affects something. My job is to make sure it affects the least risky dimension.”

Then explain:

-   Early phase → flexible scope
-   Late phase → fixed scope, flexible enhancements
-   Near launch → protect stability at all costs

That shows judgment.

## Making the Project WORK Despite All This

Here’s the CTO-approved playbook:

1.  Timebox Decisions

> “If we can’t decide in 24 hours, we go with the safest option.”

Prevents paralysis.

4.  Incremental Delivery

> “We ship the smallest version that proves value, then expand.”

This buys political and technical safety.

7.  Feature Flags

> “We build it safely but control exposure.”

CTOs love hearing this.

10.  Written Trade-Offs

> “Every major change is documented with impact.”

This protects you and the team.

## Final Power Answer (Use This If CTO Pushes You)

If the CTO asks:

> “What if the client just won’t budge?”

Say:

> “Then I escalate with options, not problems. I make the trade-offs explicit, document the decision, and execute cleanly. My responsibility is not to please everyone — it’s to deliver a stable, valuable system with eyes open to the risks.”

That answer hits:

-   Leadership
-   Accountability
-   Engineering empathy

## One-Line Summary (Memorize This)

> “I manage adamant, non-technical stakeholders by converting opinions into trade-offs, protecting the core scope, and making reprioritization explicit instead of invisible.”
