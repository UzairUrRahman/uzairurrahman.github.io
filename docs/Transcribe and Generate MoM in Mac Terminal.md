## Convert a Meeting from Video .mp4 to Audio with AI in Mac Terminal and Generating MoM's. 

### Transcribe first:

Use Whisper by OpenAI (free, open-source). It converts audio/video to text. Works on Mac/Linux/Windows.

Command example on Mac Terminal:

```
pip install openai-whisper
whisper your_meeting.mp3 --model medium
```

This outputs a transcript .txt.

### Summarize the transcript:

Feed the text into ChatGPT or any LLM to get bullet points or an executive summary.

Example prompt for AI:

> "Summarize the following meeting transcript into key decisions, action items, and important discussion points and generate a MoM for this."
